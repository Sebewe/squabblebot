# squabblebot
a fun simple bot I made to play squabble


use the initialize_bot block to use this against your friends, answer the questions it asks. When it asks for values
you want to respond with the colors of the letters (0 = grey, 1 = yellow, 2 = green). It *should* give you the 5 best guesses


I plan on improving the word selection algorithim to make it slightly better. As it stands now it takes ~3.6 guesses on average for each
word from the wordle bank. I believe this could be a lot closer to 3 if I improved my word selection algorithim, but it will take some thought so it may
take a while before it gets updated.

Feel free to download and use this against ur friends if you ever get tired of losing in squabble :))
